# EduHub MongoDB Project README

This repository contains the full implementation and optimization of a non-relational database for the EduHub online learning platform, using MongoDB as the core data store.

The project demonstrates proficiency in MongoDB schema design, CRUD operations, the Aggregation Framework for business intelligence, and performance optimization through strategic indexing.
